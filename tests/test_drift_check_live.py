"""
Live PyPI integration test for the drift-check PyPI client.

NOT part of the regular suite -- makes real network calls, so it's skipped
by default. Run explicitly with:

    RUN_LIVE_PYPI_TESTS=1 pytest test_drift_check_live.py -v

Purpose is narrow and deliberate: catch upstream PyPI JSON API schema drift
(a field renamed, a shape changed) that test_drift_check.py's mocked suite
cannot see, since it mocks the exact shape this test proves is still real.
This is NOT a place to re-test check-function logic -- that's the mocked
suite's job, and duplicating it here would just make CI flaky for no benefit.

Every assertion below is a durable, historical fact -- something true at
publication time that cannot change later (a specific release's declared
requires_python, a yank that already happened, a name that doesn't exist).
Nothing here asserts "latest version" or "is currently stale" or anything
else that legitimately changes over time; a live test asserting a moving
target breaks on schedule, not on regression.
